# The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Coding-Projects

Contains all the projects I worked on to learn how to code in C#. In this repository is a collection of scalable console applications that can be reformatted and applied to any project. It goes from simple text console applications to full on websites using the MVC and EF6 and Code-First frameworks. I created an app that compared employee wages and salaries, created array's that took in strings and numbers, created a program that quotes the user a car insurance quote based off the info their input, created an application that logged what the user wrote in another document, created an application that calculates your time, an application that allows the user to play casino games, a newletter app, and much more.
